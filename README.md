# Pomodoro-extension
Chrome extension for timing the pomodoro study method. Currently, Chrome does not have a way to fix an extension pop-up to the corner of the screen. This renders the application ineffective because it won't keep track of the timer as soon as you switch focus away from the extension. Currently looking into work-around solutions or other options for how to deploy the app. It will, however, work perfectly fine in a browser. Happy studying!
